      Qamarshan is a small but vibrant micronation built on the idea of unity, creativity,
      and community spirit. Our name means “Noble Land of Crescent”, symbolizing how we
      come together as one family no matter where we are in the world.

    <h2>The Citizen Management System</h2>
    <p>
      To keep our community connected and organized, we’ve introduced the
      <strong>Citizen Management System</strong>. This platform helps new citizens
      register, allows members to update their details, and gives leaders the tools
      they need to strengthen our nation. It’s our way of making sure that no one
      is ever left behind.

    <h2>What We Believe In</h2>
    <p>Every citizen has a home in Qamarshan. We value honesty, fairness, and trust. Together, we learn and improve as a community. Qamarshan is built on kindness and respect.</p>

    <h2>Join Us</h2>
    <p>
      Qamarshan is more than a micronation—it’s a family. Whether you’re registering
      as a new citizen or just curious to learn more, we invite you to be part of our journey.
      Together, under one moon, we shine brighter. 🌙
